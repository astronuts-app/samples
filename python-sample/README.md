# Steps to Run Astronuts Code Quality Checks on your Python Project

# Astronuts Python Reporter

Astronuts Reporter is a powerful tool that generates test reports. It's designed to be easy to use.

## Installation

To install Astronuts Reporter, open your terminal and run the following command:

### Using Pip

```bash
pip install astronuts-python-reporter
```

This command installs Astronuts Reporter as a development dependency in your project.

## Usage

To generate a test report, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
astronuts-generate
```

This command tells Astronuts Reporter library to start generating test reports.

## Integration with CI/CD Workflow

You can integrate Astronuts Reporter into your build scripts for automatic report generation, which is especially useful
in continuous integration (CI) environments where tests are run automatically.

Step 1 : Install the Astronuts Reporter package in your project.

Add Astronuts Reporter to your **requirements.txt** file:

```txt
astronuts-python-reporter
```

Then, you can install this dependency in your workflow file (e.g., .yml):

```bash
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 2 : Run the tests and generate a JUnit XML report.

```bash
- name: Generate reports
  run: |
    astronuts-generate
```

Step 3 : Run Astronuts Code Quality Checks on your Python Project.

```bash
- name: Run Astronuts Code Quality Checks
  uses: astronuts-app/astronuts-code-quality-action@v4
  with:
    sourceLanguage: 'python'
    buildSystem: 'pip'
```
